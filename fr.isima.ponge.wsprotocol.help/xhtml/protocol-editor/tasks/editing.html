<h1>Editing a protocol</h1>

<h2>Adding new elements</h2>

<p>New states and operations can be added from the palette.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To add a state, select the type that you want in the palette then click in the
    editor at the desired location. It will be added with a default size. You can also
    draw a rectangle at the creation time to have a different initial size. Alternatively,
    you can <em>drag and drop</em> from the palette a state to the desired location and it
    will create a new one with the default size.</li>
    
    <li>To add a message transition, select the type that you want from the palette, then
    select the source state by clicking on it. Similarly, click on the target state and the
    transition will be created. If the source and target states are the same, the transition
    will be automatically drawn as a loop.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Moving elements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>States can be moved by selecting them and moving them to a different location.</li>
    
    <li>Transitions can be reconnected to different source and target states. To do that, select
    either the source of target state connection point then drag it to the desired state.</li>
    
    <li>To enhance the display of transitions, bendpoints can be created. Simply select the desired
    transition, then click on the small points that appear between existing bendpoints to create new
    ones. A bendpoint that is between two other ones can be deleted by aligning it on the same segment
    formed by the other ones. From there, release the mouse and it will be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deleting elements</h2>

<p>Selected elements can be deleted by using the <em>Delete</em> action of the context menu or the <em>Edit</em>
menu. Pressing your usual <em>Delete key</em> (depending on your specification operating system / environment
combination) will also delete the selected elements.</p>

<h2>Undo / redo</h2>

<p>It is possible to redo and undo editing operations. To do that, you can use the standard <em>Undo</em> and
<em>Redo</em> actions that are available from the toolbar, the <em>Edit</em> menu and the editor contextual
menu.</p>

<h2>Changing properties</h2>

<p>When items are selected, the standard <em>Eclipse properties view</em> will change to reflect the properties
that are available for editing. For instance you can change the name of a state as well as its type.</p>
