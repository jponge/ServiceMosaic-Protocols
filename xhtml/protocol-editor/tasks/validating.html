<title>Validating a protocol</title>
</head>

<h1>Validating a protocol</h1>

<p>The business protocols editor allows to potentially design protocols that are
not well-formed. For example, one protocol could be split into two disconnected
graphs, or a non-final state could have no outgoing transitions. The goal of the
business protocols validation plug-in is to detect such problems and report them
to the user.</p>

<p>There are three different types of checkings. They can either be run individually
or collectively, by using the buttons in the view and / or double-clicking on the
checkings names in the list. Another possibility is to use the contextual menu
entry that is available from the active project view. In this case, the three 
different checkings will be run.</p>
